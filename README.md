Application
Included is a few new scripts in my script file. Such as a loop that iterates over the array to display its content and a if counditional statment that checks for the largest weighted pokemon.

I seperately added a script that should allow you to chooose an item in the array however the code is still underdeveloped.
It however does add an additional item to the console after you type a character in the prompt however it is still not the character the user typed so that is the issue.

Inlcuding in the Script file is a if conditional Statment that print out the largest weight Pokemon to the DOM with the 
document.write method. 

Some code was removed that did not fit in what the task question were asking for however it was an attempt. 

The stylesheet had a few errors from compiling. And Were fixed manually by deleted the excess code that was inserted the GitHub. All errors were fixed and the Mege was completed for the update to the GitHub server for this project.
