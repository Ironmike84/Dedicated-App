Application
I have added A few New Scripts in my script file. Such as a loop that iterates over the array to display its content.

I seperetly added a script that should allow you to chooose an item in the array however the code is still underdeveloped.
It however does add an additional item to the console after you type a character in the prompt however it is still not the character the user typed so that is the issue.

The stylesheet has not been updated. No updated are currently needed.
